# MCQ-Generator
Both the MCQ (Multiple Choice Question) Generator and the Text Classifier are natural language processing (NLP) tasks that involve processing textual data, but they serve different purposes and use different methodologies.

1. **MCQ Generator**:
   - The MCQ Generator takes a piece of text (e.g., an article, paragraph, or passage) as input.
   - It processes the text to extract key information, such as important concepts, facts, or ideas.
   - It then generates multiple-choice questions based on the extracted information.
   - To generate plausible answer choices for the questions, it might use techniques such as paraphrasing, synonym replacement, or knowledge base lookups.
   - Finally, it presents the generated questions along with the correct answer choices as the output.

2. **Text Classifier**:
   - The Text Classifier takes a piece of text (e.g., a sentence, document, or paragraph) as input.
   - It processes the text to extract features or representations that capture its semantic meaning or characteristics.
   - It then uses these features to classify the text into predefined categories or labels.
   - Common classification tasks include sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral), topic classification (sports, politics, technology), spam detection (spam/ham), and intent recognition (question, statement, request).
   - The classifier is typically trained on labeled data, where each text sample is associated with a ground-truth label.
   - After training, the classifier can predict the label for new, unseen text samples.

While both tasks involve processing textual data, the MCQ Generator focuses on generating questions and answer choices based on the content of the text, while the Text Classifier focuses on categorizing or labeling the text based on its content or characteristics. The two tasks can be implemented separately and independently, each using its own set of algorithms, techniques, and models.
